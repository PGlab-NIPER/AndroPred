# AndroPred
Androgen Receptor Inhibitor Prediction

**AndroPred* is a Deep Neural network-based model for prediction of Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitors using 
Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation of Compounds.

## Contents

The files contained in this repository are as follows:
 * ``prediction_script.py``: main script to run predictions
 * ``smiles.smi``: user input structures (multiple)
 * ``deepSSLmodel.h5``: DNN prediction model
 * ``data.csv``: training dataset
 * ``PaDEL``: folder with executable for feature calculation

## Requirements

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Keras
* Tensorflow

## Usage

In order to run AR inhibitor predictions, save input structures as SMILES in a single 
file (e.g. ``smiles.smi``) or input SMILES notation. Remember to give a name or ID to each structure.
 
1. Download this repository and ensure that all the files are present in the same folder when running the script.
2. Run ``prediction_script.py``. 
  ```bash
  python prediction_script.py <folder>
  ```
   If ``<folder>`` is not provided, the script runs in the current directory.
   A csv file (``...csv``) will be created in the folder where the script is run.
   A file containing the features generated by PaDEL will be also saved to disk (``PaDEL_features.csv``).
  
> **_NOTE:_** Remember to activate the corresponding conda environment before running the script, if applicable.
3. Prediction results will be saved in ``AR-inhibitor_predictions.csv`` which includes predicted class and associated probability
